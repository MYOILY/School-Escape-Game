## Story and Narrative
### Backstory
There is a scary rumour in Obayashi Royal Victoria School: “Never enter room 404 on the top floor! Someone died in there before”.
However, student Akane didn’t listen. She opened the door of the room and went in. The door suddenly closed and locked by itself.

Then a notice appears. It says “Why didn’t you listen to the rule? You have now been removed from the real world, you will only have 7 minutes to get the key on the third floor and open this door again to escape. Otherwise, YOU WILL BE DISAPPEARED FOREVER, your student profile will become 404 NOT FOUND in the system and no one will notice. You will be locked in this room till the end of your life." 
After that, Akane will find herself on level 1.

Akane will need to find the correct way and return to level 4 while passing through different classrooms at school. Meanwhile, she needs to be aware of some traps, such as preventing her from stepping into a red block and return back to the starting point of lv2. Player needs to find the key and unlock the door on level 4 to finish the game.

Akane is the only character in the game and there is no villain or boss. Akane is a student in this school. 
To avoid being disappeared in the real world, she needs to find the correct way to escape in a limited time.

## Gameplay and Mechanics

## Levels and World Design
### Game World 
It will be a 3D level-based game. There will be three levels. However, there isn’t any map for the player. Players can just navigate by themselves and remember the correct path. How the game world is captured on-screen depends on the player's perspective. The environment can be scrolled.
### Objects 
There will be one character moving across the game

The whole game will be escape room and parkour-based and the background will be elements at school. There will be a number of red blocks distributed on Lv2 ground. The character needs to complete this level in a Parkour style without stepping on the blocks. (Similar to Super Mario). The character needs to find the key to unlock the door on level 4 to finish the game. 

### Physics 
The physics of the game will mainly be based on the real world. The character will move like a normal human. There is a few interaction between players and npc. The only thing the character will do is find the correct path and pick up useful tools.

## Art and Audio
